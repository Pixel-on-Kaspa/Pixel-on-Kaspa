is a collective of talented individuals who thrive on challenges, combining traditional techniques with unconventional methods and mediums in their work. 

### Image content generation technology

The Image Material was generated through a unique technological process involving the scanning of a digital oscilloscope. This method utilizes a phenomenon known as Oscilloscope Music, an audiovisual form of music where visuals are directly created by the sound. To achieve the tightest possible correlation between image and sound, the audio signal sent to both the left and right speakers is simultaneously fed into the X and Y inputs of an analog oscilloscope, producing intricate Lissajous figures.

### Artistic background of the collection
NFT Collection is based on David Vrbik's research for the installation Tiling the ventilation chimneys of the Letenský Tunnel in Prague. Inspired by the pioneering work of Zdeněk Sýkora.

Zdeněk Sýkora was a pioneering artist who was among the first to harness the potential of computer technology in the creation of art. He set a precedent for subsequent generations of artists. His artistic journey saw a transition from landscape painting to abstraction, and in 1964, he collaborated with mathematician Jaroslav Blažek to produce the inaugural computer-generated programmed structures. By 1973, Sýkora had developed an innovative system centered around randomness, which laid the groundwork for his distinctive line paintings. 

Sýkora's work was showcased at numerous international exhibitions focusing on constructive art, and his pieces are held in both international and Czech collections. One of his renowned works, "Line No. 24," was integrated into the permanent collection of the Centre Pompidou in Paris in 2007. Zdeněk Sýkora passed away in Louny in 2011.

Zdeněk Sýkora’s iconic work exemplifies the successful integration of his original artistic system—based on combinatorial principles—into architecture. The foundation of this 1969 realization is his 1967 painting Black and White Structure, composed of black and white geometric elements. The glass mosaic cladding of the Letná chimneys spans 521 m² and has been a protected cultural monument of the Czech Republic since 2003.

David Vrbík studied Sýkora's work and worked it into art installations. In 2023, he focused on the cladding of the ventilation chimneys of the Letenský Tunnel.

He translated Sýkora's combinatorial principle into a musical score, created a system that respects Sykora's layout, but each element has its own variations. For example, ASCII characters, circles or colour fields.

### FRAGMENT
This collection explores a fragment of the Sýkora structure, focusing on its geometric and combinatorial principles.

Each piece consists of a **12 × 12** matrix of elements.

Sýkora designed nine basic elements, each with four rotational variations, creating a total of thirty-six unique elements arranged by a precise ratio of black and white areas.

David Vrbík translates this system into a musical scale, where the composition randomly plays individual fields in four-part polyphony. Through this process, visual structures emerged, forming the backbone of the Sykora NFT Collection.
